Matchers are used by the expect function, which is global available and must not be imported.
There are a lot matchers, but here are some more important:
- expect(["a", "b"]).toHaveLength(2) -> Array has a specific number of elements
- expect(5).toEqual(5)
- expected("aber").toContain("b") 
- expect(fn).toThrow() -> Does function throws exception?
- expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled() -> Was mock function called?
- expect(element).toBeInTheDocument() -> element in document?
- expect(element).toBeEnabled() -> Element (like a button) is not disabled?
- expect(element).toHaveClass() -> Does element has a class name?
- expect(element).toHaveTextContent() -> Does element has particular text?
- expect(element).toHaveValue() -> Does input, select or textarea specific value?
